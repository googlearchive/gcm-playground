GCM Playground
============

A reference implementation of a [GCM Application Server](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/server#role) in the form of a playground that developers can use to test the Google Cloud Messaging Service.


Introduction
------------

GCM Playground can be used to experiment sending and receiving messages with the [Google Cloud Messaging](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging) API. The playground can be used as a sample implementation of the GCM App Server, that you can use as a reference for your own app server implementation.

#### What's Included

- **App Server (`server/`)**: Written in Go (Golang) is a [GCM Application Server](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/server#role).
- **Playground UI (`web/`)**: Made with Polymer, it is the main component that you will for sending downstream messages and receiving upstream messages.
- **Client apps (`android/`, `chrome/`, `web/`)**: These client apps are used in conjunction with the playground UI to test various features of the GCM API.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Learn more about [Google Cloud Messaging](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm)
- Watch the ["Re-engage your users with GCM notifications"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxbidYYAek8) DevByte video 

#### Set Up an API Project and Credentials

- Follow [this link to Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=googlecloudmessaging) create a project with Google Cloud Messaging enabled.
- You can create a new project here, or choose an existing project to enable GCM in.
- Once the project has been created, you can find your project ID and project number on the **Home** page of the project. For example, **Project Number: 670330094152**.
- Copy down your project number. You will use it later on as the [GCM sender ID](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm.html#senderid).


Getting Started
---------------

#### Installation

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), and if using on a Mac [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/).
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) >=0.12.0.
- Clone this repo.
- `$ ./start.sh`

If the last command fails, you might need to give execute permission to the script. Do `$ chmod +x start.sh` and retry.



#### Accessing services

If using docker machine, run `docker-machine ls` to find out the VM IP address.

If using boot2docker, run `$ boot2docker ip` to find out the VM IP address. Usually, the IP is `192.168.59.103`.

The ports that are being used are:

- **`3000` - Playground Web UI**
- `4260` - App server

When using mobile app clients, you would want to tunnel the app server traffic so it's accessible via the public network. To do that, download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and run `$ ./ngrok http <IP ADDRESS>:4260`. Optionally, you can also deploy the playground on any public cloud and use the server's address.


#### Configuration

The following must be set before you can start using the GCM Playground:

- Login to your [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
- In the sidebar, under **APIs & Auth**, click on **Credentials**.
- Then generate an **API Key**. Make sure it's a Server Key.

`server/server.go`

    // API key from Cloud console
    apiKey = ""

    // GCM sender ID
    senderId = ""

`web/app/settings.json`

You should only need to change the IP address here. Replace `192.168.59.103` with the IP address that `docker-machine ls` or `boot2docker ip` gives you.

    "main": {
      "sendMessageEndpoint": "http://192.168.59.103:4260/message",
      "clientsEndpoint": "http://192.168.59.103:4260/clients",
      "socketEndpoint": "http://192.168.59.103:4260/"
    },

Chrome App
-----------

![](_docs/chrome.png)

Included in `chrome/` is a Chrome app that can help you get started with the playground. The Chrome app lets you:

- Register the client with the backend
- Receive messages sent through the playground

#### Usage

- Open Chrome and go to menu > **Tools > Extensions**.
- Click **Developer mode > Load unpacked extensions...**
- Browse to and **Select** the `chrome/` folder.
- On the Extensions page, **Launch** GCM Playground Receiver app.


Android App
------------

![](_docs/android.png)

Included in `android/` is an Android app that can help you get started with the playground. The Android app lets you:

- Register and unregister the client with the backend
- Receive messages sent through the playground
- Subscribe to topics using Pubsub
- Send upstream messages

#### Usage

- Follow the [quickstart guide](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/) to set up your project in Android Studio.
- Run the sample on your Android device.
- Use the playground web UI to send a message to the registered device.
- A notification containing the GCM message should be displayed on the device.

iOS App
------------

![](_docs/ios.png)

Included in `ios/` is an iOS app that can help you get started with the playground. The iOS app lets you:

- Register and unregister the client with the backend
- Receive messages sent through the playground
- Subscribe to topics using Pubsub
- Send upstream messages

#### Usage

- Follow the [quickstart guide](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/ios/start) to set up your project in XCode.
- Run the sample on your iOS device.
- Use the playground web UI to send a message to the registered device.
- A notification containing the GCM message should be displayed on the device.

Note: You need Swift 1.2 to run the app.
